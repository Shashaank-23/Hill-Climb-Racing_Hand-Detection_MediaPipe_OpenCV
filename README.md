# Hill-Climb-Racing_Hand-Detection_MediaPipe_OpenCV
Automated Hill Climb Racing game with hand detection using Media pipe and OpenCV in Python.

# WHAT THE PROJECT DOES ?
This project focusses on automating Hill Climb Racing game using open-source frameworks such as MediaPipe and OpenCV that provide a wide range of libraries and tools 
to apply Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI) techniques over arbitrary sensory data such as image, video and audio.

This project mainly involves raw video and image data which is taken from live webcam feed and the desired output (i.e. controlling the mobility of a vehicle) is 
rendered based on the received input.

# WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL ?
This project is useful to visualize and understand how AI/ML techniques work in realtime scenarios...and at the same time looks cool! :)  

# WHO MAINTAINS AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROJECT ?
Currently, this project is maintained by me @Shashaank-23 but anyone with the will and enthusiasm to work on the same can play around and have fun with this code.

Happy Coding!
